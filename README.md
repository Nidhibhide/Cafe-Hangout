 I designed and developed an application for generating bills for a caf√©. The application incorporates password encoding and decoding for enhanced security. Technologies used in this project include Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, JPA, XAMPP, MySQL, and Spring Security. The combination of these technologies ensured a robust and secure application, capable of managing and processing billing information efficiently. The project highlights my ability to integrate multiple frameworks and tools to create a functional and secure software solution.
